**What is important in a class is where you end up relative to yourself in week zero**

- Computer science is about problem solving. Oftentimes these problems have to be solved collaboratively.

problem -> ALGORITHM -> solution

- In order to start solving problems we need to have a way of representing them.
- Computers use binary since a circuit can only have 2 states - OFF(0) and ON(1)
- By using combinations of bits, computers are able to count. By relating bits to other symbols, we can represent letters (ASCII, UNICODE) and colors (RGB)
- Abstraction involves taking low level implementation details and simplifying them so that we can focus on solving the greater problem. It involves understanding the low level details first then deciding that it is not a useful level to conceptually think about problems.
- ASCII uses a byte (8 bits) to represent characters and as a result you can only have 256 characters in it.
- Nowadays devices use UNICODE (specifically a version called UTF-8) which uses up to 4 bytes to represent characters and can represent millions of characters (hence the explosion of emojis)
- Building blocks for a language include (among others) - variables, functions, conditions, boolean expressions, events and threads.
